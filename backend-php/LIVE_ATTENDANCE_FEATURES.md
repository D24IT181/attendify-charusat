2. System generates QR code and attendance link
3. Teacher navigates to QRCodePage to display QR code

### 2. Live Updates

1. Students scan QR code and mark attendance
2. Attendance data stored in `attendance_records` table
3. Frontend polls API every 10 seconds for updates
4. Teacher sees live count and recent attendance list

### 3. Real-time Display

1. Student count updates automatically
2. Recent attendance list shows latest check-ins
3. Timestamps show when each student marked attendance
4. Loading states provide visual feedback

## Technical Details

- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Caching**: No caching - always fresh data for real-time accuracy

### Frontend

- **Polling**: 10-second intervals for automatic updates
- **State Management**: React state for live data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for API failures
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during updates

### Security

- **Input Validation**: All parameters validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection**: Prepared statements prevent attacks
- **Access Control**: Same authentication as other endpoints

## Usage Examples
